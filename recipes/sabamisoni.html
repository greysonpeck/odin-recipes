    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Saba Misoni is a classic Japanese home cooked dish where mackerel fillets
      are simmered in miso sauce along with ginger. Tender and flavorful, it
      goes beautifully with steamed rice!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 fillets mackerel (saba) (13 oz, 375g)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For seasoning #1</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>4 Tbsp water</li>
      <li>4 Tbsp sake</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp mirin</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp sugar</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp miso</li>
      <li>1 knob ginger</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For seasoning #2</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 Tbsp miso</li>
      <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h4>Prepare ingredients</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Scrape off the skin from 1 knob ginger with a knife (or a spoon) and cut
        into thin slices. Keep half the slices for cooking the fish and use the
        other half for the next step.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the other ginger slices into thin julienned strips and transfer to a
        plate. This is for garnish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut each of the 2 fillets mackerel (saba) in half, in a slanted angle
        (this creates more surface to absorb flavors). Make a shallow cross
        incision on the skin side of the thickest part of the fillets.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Blanch the fish</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, gently add a
        fillet, one at a time, for a quick blanch to remove the sliminess,
        smell, and impurities. Scoop up the fish with a fine-mesh strainer or a
        slotted spoon. Alternatively, you can pour boiling water over the
        fillets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Quickly shock the fish in the ice bath. And repeat this blanch/ice bath
        process with the rest of the fillets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Clean the fish in the ice water, removing blood or any impurities. The
        ice water helps firming up the flesh of the fish as well. Once clean,
        transfer to a plate/tray and set aside.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Cook the fish</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a medium/large saucepan, add the Seasoning #1—4 Tbsp water, 4 Tbsp
        sake, 2 Tbsp mirin, 2 Tbsp sugar, 2 Tbsp miso (keep the other 2 Tbsp
        miso for later), and 1 knob gingerhe ginger slices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the heat to medium and bring the sauce to a boil while mixing the
        ingredients.
      </li>
      <li>When boiling, place mackerel in a single layer, skin side up.</li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium-low and put an otoshibuta (drop lid). Gently
        simmer for 13–15 minutes. Otoshibuta keeps the fish down and helps the
        sauce circulate over the fish.
      </li>
    </ol>
